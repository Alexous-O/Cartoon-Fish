# Cartoon-Fish

## Project Description 

The goal of this project is to make a project with HTML and CSS using images as background, using FlexBox to improve and understand how it works. A start of JavaScript for the scollbar as well as the animations of the train, the moon and the man on the boat.

A super interesting, very constructive project, which allowed me to use my personal knowledge to solve some small bugs!
